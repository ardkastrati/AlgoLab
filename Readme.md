# AlgoLab

My solutions on Algorithms Lab at ETH Zurich. The idea of this course is to learn to learn to solve problems fast, efficient and without mistakes. Each problem is solvable with less than 100 lines of code. 

Some of the algorithms and libraries that we use in this course are:

1. Dynamic programming
2. Linear Programming
3. Quadratic Programming
4. Greedy
5. Split & List
6. Binary Search
7. Graph algorithms with BGL
	7.1. Basics such as Dijkstra, MST, BFS, DFS, SCC, Blossom algorithm
	7.2. Flows such as Push-Relabel, Edmonds-Karp
	7.3. Advanced Flows such as minimum cost flows, matchings and cuts.
8. Geometric algorithms with CGAL
	8.1. Bounding Volumes such as Convex Hull, Minimum Enclosing Circle
	8.2. Triangulations
	8.3. Voronoi Diagrams
